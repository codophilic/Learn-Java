# About Programming

- Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a special language designed to communicate with computers.
- A programming language is a set of instructions written by a programmer to deliver instructions to the computer to perform and accomplish a task. This set of instructions is usually viewed as incomprehensible code structured following a definite programming language syntax.

## Types of Programming

**1. Low Level**
  - Also known as machine language, this is the only language computers understand. It's made up of binary numbers (1s and 0s) and is machine-friendly, but hard for humans to understand. Low-level languages are closer to machine code, offering more control and efficiency, but are harder to program. They are often used in system programming, operating systems, and device drivers

**2. Middle-level**
  - Also known as assembly language, this level uses letters, digits, and special characters to create instructions. Assembly language uses predefined words called mnemonics.

**3. High-level**
  - These languages are easier to understand and debug, and are widely used today. They are portable and do not depend on machines. High-level languages are more human-readable and abstracted from hardware, making them easier to program but less efficient. They allow for faster development time since they require less coding and debugging. Examples include Java, C, C++, Python, Perl, BASIC, COBOL, Pascal, and Ruby.

# About Java
- Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Lets see how good is java.

- Lets first install java and check its version by running command `java -version`.

- If you see currently we are using **Java 21 LTS** (Long Term Support). Lets create world famous code **Hello World!**.
- So we create a file and with name **Hello World.java** . So any java file will have an extension of **.java**.
