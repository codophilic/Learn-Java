## Serialization & Deserialization

- Imagine you are playing one of the popular game **BGMI (PUB-G)**. You choose one character based on gender and accordingly you pick up dressing style for your character. Now apart from that your character killing score, its stats, matches played etc.. all this details are store somewhere in your mobile app. So when you open again, those details are still present, it does not get vanished.
- Apart from that, when a player shoots another player, the shooting action by the player gets reflected on the screen of another player. This will only happen via network. So your shooting data is transmitted over the network which is been caught by the same app installed on another player mobile.
- In java, serialization and deserialization works similarly.
- **Serialization:** Java Serialization is a mechanism by which Java objects can be converted into a byte stream. This byte stream data can be saved to a file, sent over a network or stored in memory.
- **Deserialization:** Java Deserialization is a mechanism by which byte stream (0's and 1's) fetched over the network, memory or file can be converted back again to its original java objects.

- In java if a class implements **java.io.Serializable**, then those classes object can serialize and deserialize. Lets see an example.

```



```

- not all classes and object can be serialize, .ser is not always the extension.
